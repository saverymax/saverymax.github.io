Welcome to my personal site. I'm using this as a place for blog posts about statistics, machine learning, and other science-related topics.

Currently, I'm working on a PhD at Ghent University. The project is titled "Optimum survey design for the study of spatial(-temporal) data".
I work with spatial and temporal statistical models, all in the context of experimental design. This brings together a variety of statistical topics and 
is quite an interesting project for that reason. Below you can find some blog posts I've made about various areas of my work.
