My name is Max Savery. I am a PhD student at Ghent University in the Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, BioStat group. 
The group's page can be found [here](https://biostat.ugent.be/). 

I have experience in a variety of statistical topics as well as some applied machine learning areas, though my machine learning days are getting farther and farther behind me.
In a previous life I worked in genetics and molecular biology. Within statistics, I am interested in Bayesian and hierarchical modelling, optimal and experimental design, temporal (time-series) and spatial modelling, computational practicalities, ecological and environmental applications, and some philosophical statisticals issues. Beyond science and statistcs, my personal interests include art, writing, and bikes.
