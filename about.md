My name is Max Savery. I am a PhD student at Ghent University in the Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, BioStat group. The group's page can be found [here](https://biostat.ugent.be/). Currently, my project is titled "Optimum survey design for the study of spatial(-temporal) data". I work with spatial and temporal statistical models, all in the context of experimental design. This brings together a variety of statistical topics and is quite an interesting project for that reason. The [Blog Posts](/blog_posts) page contains some short vignettes about various areas of my work.

I have experience in a variety of statistical topics as well as some applied machine learning areas, though my machine learning days are getting farther and farther behind me.
In a previous life I worked in genetics and molecular biology. Within statistics, I am interested in Bayesian and hierarchical modelling, optimal and experimental design, temporal (time-series) and spatial modelling, computational practicalities, ecological and environmental applications, and some philosophical statisticals issues. Beyond science and statistcs, my personal interests include art, writing, and bikes.
